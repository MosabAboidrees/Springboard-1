    "## Introducing TalkRecommender\n",
    "Talk recommender is a recommendation system that recommends talks from this year's Pycon based on the ones that you went to last year.  This way you don't waste any time preparing a schedule and get to see the talks that matter the most to you! \n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the demo, the users are asked to label previous year's talks into two categories - the one that they went to in person, and the ones they watched later online. Talk Recommender uses those labels to predict talks from this year that will be interesing to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) abd [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/) to build and the model.\n",

# Ways to improve

- Label optional vs mandatory exercises
- Specifications to run Jupyter notebook in the environment that was created.
- Present the "test loop" on the "increment" function.
- Start with the min-max scaler.
- Spend more time: `missingno`, `pandas-summary`
- Good things: interactive, what kinds of tests. Deliberately eliminate one that's obvious to everybody.
- More frequent breaks.
- Environments.
- Don't try working in Hypothesis. The audience might not be suitable. Write it up as a more complete set of things that can be explored on own time.
- Short section at the end for common troubleshooting issues.
- More explanation at the end of notebooks to continue learning.
- How to incorporate testing in different workflows.
- Resources section.

# Stuff you've learned

- Write the function and the test, and see what happens on the edge cases.
- High-level unit testing theory: approach being test-->function.
- "Testing, period"
- YAML. Now know what YAML's about.
- Mindful role playing was helpful, esp. for knowing what to look out for.

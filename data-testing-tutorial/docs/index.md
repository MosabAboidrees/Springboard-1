# Best Testing Practices for Data Science

This contains static HTML versions of the Jupyter notebooks that I have made for this tutorial.

Before beginning, start with the README to get a flavour of what you'll need to know before beginning the tutorial.

After that, work through Notebooks 1-3 in order first. Bonus notebooks 1-3 are intended for you to explore at your own pace. Bonus notebook 4 contains projects that can be attempted at your free time to gain practice with testing.
